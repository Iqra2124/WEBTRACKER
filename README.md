# WEBTRACKER: Building a Chrome Extension to Track Websites Visited
See attached poster for more detail (Webtracker_Poster_Final.pdf)

This extension allows you to record the timestamps of when you changed websites through google chrome. 
For exaple, when you go from google to youtube it will tell you at what time google was left, what time youtube began loading, and finally at what time youtube completed loading.
This is done using chrome API and JavaScript knowledge to achieve this output.
Also outputs these timestamps with information to a server for later analysis.

If interested in having this extension, follow the guides in the Guides folder
