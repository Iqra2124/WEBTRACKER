# WEBTRACKER: Building a Chrome Extension to Track Websites Visited
Anonymity tools such as VPNs and Tor protect what you are browsing on the Internet. However, attackers can still see the packet sizes, which can then be used to predict the website. We created a web browser extension to record what websites users are visiting (both in regular HTTPS and using VPN/Tor) to see whether the website can be de-anonymized. We gained basic knowledge in JavaScript, jQuery, and the fundamentals of running and saving to a database. This project's aim is to collect data that can lead to better methods for anonymity on the web.
