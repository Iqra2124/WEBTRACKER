What this project is good for
    - Quick intro to full stack development at the level of a Chrome Extension
    - Great understanding of the functionality of JavaScript and its extensions (jQuery, AJAX, etc.)
    - Provides understanding of the anatomy of the web (server side, client side, etc.)

What to still work on
    - Write to a database
        - Specifically have background.js talk to script.php correctly so that 
          in phpmyadmin's database that is created we see our string input appear
    - Options page to fit in timing so results are consistent 
      (instead of manually turning on/off)
        - Use options.js and options.html to accomplish this
        - save value to chrome.storage.local to be consistent
