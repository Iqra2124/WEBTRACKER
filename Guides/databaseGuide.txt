This guide covers setting up the database through a Linux command line
If you would like to do the same download mySQL like so
    sudo apt-get install mysql-server
This will install mysql and now you can create your local database
Also you will need phpmyadmin :)
And Apache!
You will have to find these commands yourself :(

To access your sql now do
    mysql -uroot -p
From here you will have to insert your password which you probably already set up
The default password provided in the code 
(which you will have to change if you have a different password)
is 'pizza'
Maybe use 'pizza' it is good and you can always change later
If you want a different password make sure to 
change the 'pizza' parameter for $bridge in script.php

Now we need to create our database
We want to stay consistent with the code provided so we will call our database 'sites'
The command to create our database is
    CREATE DATABASE sites;
Now that you have created your database we need to access it
Do the command
    USE sites;

Now you are in the database. We want to create a table to stor our information
Since we will only be passing a single string argument follow this command
Note: After a line use the 'Enter' key as sql recognized this to move only
      Also note the '->' notation is what sql will present as a way to say
      you are continuing writing to a given call

    CREATE TABLE collect(
        -> input VARCHAR(100)
        ->);
    )
Great! Now we have our table that we can send information to
To view the entries of your database do
    SELECT * FROM collect;
You should get a return of 'Empty set (0.00 sec)'
This is because we have not written anything to the table yet

Lets do a test to see if the table works well.
Lets manually input a fake call to do this we do
    INSERT INTO collect(
        -> input)
        -> VALUES(
        -> '31,youtube.com,0,151241251');
After this you should get the message 'Query OK, 1 row affexted (0.06 sec)'
Now to view if the data was written correctly do the call
    SELECT * FROM collect;
If it looks like a table everything is going well
Now let us delete this entry since it is not real data
To do this we writte
    DELETE FROM collect;
Now to see if the entry was deleted we do 
    SELECT * FROM collect;
If you get the return message of 'Empty Set (0.04 sec)'
You have done everything correctly and your database is ready
to collect WebTrackers data!
