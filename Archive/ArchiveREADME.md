# Guides

Guides was created for an older version, 
for someone to host and use the app themselves

Since I did get the Provost Fellowship, 
we expanded the project and have a server set up.

The server is set up by my Provost mentor, Eric.

If you want to create your own server or see the thought process
visit the 'Guides' folder



# Older Server Stuff

This folder of items was created before the server was up

It was meant for us to host originally a mySQL database
the script.php was overkill, so we decided to use a simple Java server

The Java server became obselete once we used Eric's server
that server is much better and is our current use
