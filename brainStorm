How to work the onUpdated

First: Explanation of onUpdated
  - onUpdated will return information of you add a listener, 
    which its callback takes parameters
      - integer tabId
          - use null to specify all tabs in question
          - a specific tabId will only check a certain state
      - object changeInfo
          - allows you to pick what you want to track that has been changed
          - Lists the changes to the state of the tab that was updated
          - Most important: string-url or string-status (loading or complete)
              - for url we want to only worry about the 'anchor' changing
      - Tab tab
          - will return the state of the tab that was updated.
          - Note: this is not like query that requires a tab array
Remember, listeners are always listening so we do not want multiple listeners 
within a listener.
