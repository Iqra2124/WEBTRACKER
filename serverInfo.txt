What needs to be done for the Java server

Right now the server is communicating with the chrome extension which is good, but it is returning none UTF-8 typology.
Need to find a way to fix it. 
Experimented with certain methods but there seems to be an issue of understanding between chrome and server.

After we get this to work we want to work on multiple users using the server.
