The way it seems that we need to match URL's is based in Chrome's API

https://developer.chrome.com/apps/events 
See this link to see certain arguments we can pass within background.js to view all 
types of matches URL can have.
    see UrlFilter

https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/samples
See Live HTTP headers
We can also look into creating a header.js and header.html which will require more 
coding but it can allow for more manipulation of the data. 
The manipulation provided here is extensive.
