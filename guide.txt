assumption that everything will be installed onto  the person's browser
Because of this I just need to work through some main parts

Chrome:
    - Installing Extension
        - visit:
        - click ...
    - To start recording
        - click the icon at the top right of your browser (extension bar)
            - Show picture of entire browser
        - To switch recording state click the slider
        - If Green on this means the websites you visit are being sent
            - Show picture of popup "ON" state
        - If Red off this means that none of your web information is being sent
            - Show picture of popup "OFF" state

Mozilla:
    - Installing Extension
        - visit:
        - click ...
    - To start recording
        - click the icon at the top right of your browser (extension bar)
            - Show picture of entire browser
        - To switch recording state click the slider
        - If Green on this means the websites you visit are being sent
            - Show picture of popup "ON" state
        - If Red off this means that none of your web information is being sent
            - Show picture of popup "OFF" state

Now put this into a word doc and export as PDF
