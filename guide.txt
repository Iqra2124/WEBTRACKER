assumption that everything will be installed onto  the person's browser
Because of this I just need to work through some main parts

Chrome:
    - Installing Extension
        - visit:
        - click ...
    - To start recording
        - click the icon at the top right of your browser (extension bar)
            - Show picture of entire browser
        - To switch recording state click the slider
        - If Green on this means the websites you visit are being sent
            - Show picture of popup "ON" state
        - If Red off this means that none of your web information is being sent
            - Show picture of popup "OFF" state
    - To change the length of time WEBTRACKER will record for (default is 10 seconds)
        - Right click the icon of WEBTRACKER
        - And scroll down to and chose options
            - Show picture of drop down menu to go to options
        - Options page will open up in a new tab
        - To change the amount of time you want to record your information just
          type in the text box. Time inputted is in milliseconds.
          So if you want seconds * 1000
          If you want minutes mutiply by 60000
            - Show picture of say 30000 out in and caption is for 30 seconds
        - Click save time and time time recorded will be the new standard
            - Show picture just in case
        - You can exit out of tab

Mozilla:
    - Installing Extension
        - visit:
        - click ...

        - click the icon at the top right of your browser (extension bar)

        - And scroll down to and chose Manage Extension
            - Show picture of drop down menu to go to Manage Extension
        - Manage Extension page will open up in a new tab
        - You should see a screen like this
            - Show screenshot of manage extension
        - Go over to Preferences it should look like this
            - Show screenshot of being on preferences page with textbox present
        - To change the amount of time you want to record your information just
          type in the text box. Time inputted is in milliseconds.
          So if you want seconds * 1000
          If you want minutes mutiply by 60000
            - Show picture of say 30000 out in and caption is for 30 seconds
